# About our Data

The data we are working with is a dataset on Penguins, which includes 8 features measured on 44 penguins. The features included are physiological features (like bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, etc) as well as other features like the year that the penguin was observed, the island the penguin was observed on, the sex of the penguin, and the species of the penguin. 

# Interesting Questions to Ask

+ What is the average flipper length? What about for each species?

+ Are there more male or female penguins? What about per island or species?

+ What is the average body mass? What about by island? By species? By sex?

+ What is the ratio of bill length to bill depth for a penguin? What is the overall average of this metric? Does it change by species, sex, or island?

+ Does average body mass change by year?

# Data Manipulation Tools and Strategies

+ We can look at individual columns in a data set or subsets of columns in a data set. For example, if we're only interested in flipper length and species, we can `select()`  those columns. 

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, body_mass_g)
  
```


If we want to `filter()` and only show certain rows, we can do that too. 

```{r}
# we can filter by sex (categorical variables)
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap")

# we can also filter by numerical variables
penguins %>%
  filter(body_mass_g >=6000)

# we can also do both
penguins %>%
  filter((body_mass_g >= 6000) | (island == "Torgersen"))
```

# Answering Our Questions

Most of our questions involve summarizing data, and perhaps summarizing over groups. We can summarize data using the `summarize()` function, and group data using `group_by()`.

Let's find the average flipper length.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(avg_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm))

# Single Species Average
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Gentoo") %>%
  summarize (avg_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm))

# Grouped Average
penguins %>%
  group_by(species)
```

How many of each species do we have?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  count(species)
```

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  count(sex)
```

We can use `mutate()` to aedd new columns to our data set. 

```{r}
#To make a permanent change, we need to store the results of our manipulations
penguins_with_ratio <- penguins  %>%
  mutate(bill_ltd_ratio = bill_length_mm / bill_depth_mm)

#Average Ratio
penguins %>%
  mutate(bill_ltd_ratio = bill_length_mm / bill_depth_mm) %>%
  summarize(mean_bill_ltd_ratio = mean(bill_ltd_ratio), median_bill_ltd_ratio = median(bill_ltd_ratio))

#Average Ratio by Group
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
   mutate(bill_ltd_ratio = bill_length_mm / bill_depth_mm) %>%
  summarize(mean_bill_ltd_ratio = mean(bill_ltd_ratio), median_bill_ltd_ratio = median(bill_ltd_ratio))
```
Average body mass by year
```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(mean_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```
# Data Visualization Rules
+ One numerical variable - histogram/barplot
+ One categorical - barplot
+ Two numerical variables - scatterplot
+ Two categorical variables - barplots with fill 
+ One numerical and one categorical variable - side-by-side boxplots "faceting" 
```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = flipper_length_mm), 
                 bins = 15, 
                 fill = " green", 
                 color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Flipper Length (mm)", subtitle = "Mean in black, Median in Red", y = "", x = "Flipper Length (mm)") + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(flipper_length_mm)), lwd = 2, lty = "dashed") + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(flipper_length_mm)), lwd = 2, lty = "dotdash", color = "red")
```
# We will now look at the distribution of species. 
```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = species), color = "black", fill = "white") + labs(title = "Counts of Penguin Species", x = "Species", y = "Count")
```
# Let's make a scatter plot to see if bill length is correlated with bill depth. 
```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species), method = "lm")
```
